Gold prices plunged more than 12% to below $5,000 an ounce, the sharpest daily drop since the early 1980s, according to Live Mint and Reuters data cited by ET Now. On the MCX, gold futures fell by ₹33,113, or 18%, to ₹1,50,849 per kg, while silver dropped ₹1,07,971, or 27%, to ₹2,91,922 per 10 grams. The fall came after prices had hit record highs earlier in the week, capping a strong rally through 2025.

A surge in the US dollar followed President Donald Trump’s confirmation of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Analysts told Hindustan Times and The Financial Express that this dollar rebound prompted aggressive profit booking in gold and silver markets. Earlier gains had been supported by a weaker dollar, geopolitical tensions, central bank buying, and high inflation. 

City-wise data from Live Mint and Hindustan Times showed declines across India on 1 February, with 24K gold mostly around ₹1.50 lakh–₹1.69 lakh per 10 grams. Chennai recorded the highest price at ₹1,73,010, while Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata saw rates near ₹1.50 lakh. The drop coincided with Union Budget day, adding to market volatility.

Silver, which had risen over 60% in a month due to its dual role as a safe-haven and industrial metal, plunged nearly 30% in India and 26% globally. Hindustan Times reported prices fell from record highs of ₹4,04,500 per kg to about ₹3,12,000, erasing much of January’s gains. Analysts cited the US dollar rebound and overbought conditions as key drivers of the correction.
