A 30-year-old former executive assistant has turned a late‑night baking hobby into a seven‑figure bakery business, after quitting her full‑time job in 2022 to focus on building what is now a rapidly expanding brand. Abi Caswell, founder of Batter, runs two thriving storefronts in Louisiana, US, with annual sales crossing seven figures.

Caswell’s shift into baking began almost accidentally, she told CNBC Make It. While working a conventional 8‑to‑5.30 pm job, she would spend her nights baking until 1 am, creating cakes as a hobby. But after she baked a cake for a friend’s husband, another friend insisted she should start selling them. Encouraged, she spent six months perfecting her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe, testing countless batches despite having no prior baking experience.

When her products began attracting traction online and locally, she decided to quit her job in spring 2022. “It was just too much,” she said, recalling the long days and late‑night baking.
