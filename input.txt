An Indian woman living in Canada chose to wear a traditional Marathi nauvari saree for her Canadian citizenship oath ceremony, celebrating her roots as she shared the video of the experience on social media.

The video was shared on Instagram by Divya Lotlikar with the caption: "Proud to be where I am without forgetting where I'm from. Keeping my roots alive."

The clip begins with Divya debating what to wear for the ceremony, seen considering a formal dress or a suit, which were typical choices for such official events.

The reel then transitions to her confidently stepping into the oath ceremony dressed in a traditional Marathi nauvari saree, paired with traditional jewellery and a neatly tied bun, standing out gracefully among the formal setting and national flags in the background.
